# Data Protection and Privacy Policy for Webparts designed by SharePoint Designs

## Overview

This document provides an overview of how personal data is handled, stored, and processed by the custom SharePoint Online webparts developed for Intranet portals by SharePoint Designs. It is intended to support internal Software Assurance and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) processes, and to demonstrate compliance with GDPR and our internal data governance standards.

## 1. Data Handling

### 1.1 Data Collection

* **No Client Data Collection:**

  Our webparts do not collect or store any client data. All data processed by the webparts is sourced directly from SharePoint Online within the client’s own Microsoft 365 environment.
* **License Processing:**
  For the sole purpose of license management, we collect only the following:

  * Microsoft 365 Tenant ID
  * SharePoint Online Site URL

  No additional personal or business data is collected, transmitted, or stored by our webparts outside the client’s SharePoint environment.

### 1.2 Data Processing

* All processing activities performed by the webparts are limited strictly to data already present in the client’s SharePoint Online environment.
* No data is exported, transmitted, or processed outside the boundaries of the client’s Microsoft 365 tenancy.
* The Tenant ID and SharePoint URL, collected for license processing, are handled securely and used exclusively for license validation.
* Processing is performed in accordance with [Microsoft’s compliance commitments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) and our organization’s data governance policies.

## 2. Data Storage

* All SharePoint data accessed or processed by the webparts remains within the Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online platform, stored in Microsoft-managed datacenters.
* No client data (other than Tenant ID and SharePoint URL for licensing) is stored or transmitted to external systems by the webparts.
* The Tenant ID and SharePoint URL used for license processing are stored securely and are not shared with third parties.

## 3. Data Access and Control

* The webparts operate entirely within the scope of the client’s existing SharePoint Online access controls and permissions.
* Only users authorized within the client’s Microsoft 365 tenancy can access or interact with data through the webparts.
* The license management data (Tenant ID and SharePoint URL) is accessible only to authorized personnel for the purpose of license verification.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

* No client data is retained by the webparts or transferred outside SharePoint Online.
* Tenant ID and SharePoint URL collected for licensing are retained only for the duration necessary to manage licensing and are deleted upon license termination or as required by the client.

## 5. Security Measures

* The webparts inherit the security measures and compliance standards of Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online, including encryption at rest and in transit.
* Secure development practices are followed, and the webparts are routinely reviewed for security and compliance.

## 6. Compliance References

* [Microsoft GDPR Compliance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr)
