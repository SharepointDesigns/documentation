## ðŸ§ª Free Trial & Subscription

- When the web part is added to a SharePoint page, a **free 15-day trial** starts automatically.
- After the trial period ends, users will need to **purchase a license key** to continue using the web part.
- The activation process is simple and guided â€” once the trial expires, users can click the **Activate** button on the web part, which opens a dialog with a **"Get Key"** option that redirects them to the payment page.
