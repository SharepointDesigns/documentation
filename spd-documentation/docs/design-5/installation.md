   - `AnnouncementList` list
   - `Welcome Banner` library
   - `Event Flyer` library
     (_Mock items are added automatically for Announcements, News, QuickLinks, and Events._)

5. After the items are created, the site page will **refresh automatically**, and it will continue to creating page and adding webparts.
